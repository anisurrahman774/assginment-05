                    DOM?</h1>
                <p>
                    <span class="font-semibold"> I consider a DOM element "hard to be selected" if it fills 5
                        terms:</span> <br>

                    1.It doesn't have any identifiers whatsoever (ID's, Classes or unique attributes). <br>

                    2.Its Xpath is created dynamically in each server creation of a webpage. <br>

                    3.It's one of many elements of the same tag (say, div), and the number of these is also dynamic, so
                    a
                    specific item reference like document.querySelector('div'), will be principally ineffective. <br>

                    4.It is a bit frustrating to target by the HTML alone given that the road from a parent element with
                    an ID is quite large (like 25-30 elements). It's also impossible in case the ID is created
                    dynamically. <br>

                    5.Other elements share the same textContent of the element (though these will appear on viewport
                    only
                    if you'll open accordions that contain them).

                    formatting
                    purposes only. <br>
                    2.innerText: innerText returns all text contained by an element and all its child elements. <br>
                    3.innerHtml: innerHtml returns all text, including html tags, that is contained by an element.

                <p>
                    Event delegation in the DOM is a JavaScript technique that uses a single event listener to handle
                    events for multiple child elements. It's a design pattern that takes advantage of event propagation.

                <p>
                    <span class="font-semibold mt-2">How does event delegation work?</span><br>
                    .When an event occurs on a child element, it bubbles up the DOM tree. <br>
                    .The parent element's event listener handles the event based on the target element. <br>
                    .The parent element handles the event for all of its child elements. <br>

                <h1 class="font-bold text-2xl mb-2">Question-4: What is event bubbling in the DOM?</h1>
                <p>Bubbling in the DOM is an event propagation method. It starts with an event triggering on the
                    innermost element and then proceeds to trigger the same event on its parent element and then its
                    parent's parent element and so on.</p>

                    JavaScript?</h1>
                <p>
                    To add, remove, and modify HTML elements using JavaScript, you can use methods like createElement ,
                    appendChild , removeChild , and properties like innerHTML and textContent . For example, to add an
                    element, you can create it using document. createElement and then append it to a parent element
                    using appendChild .
